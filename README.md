# OS_xv6_project
operating system course project first phase instructed by [Dr.Seyyed Ahmad Javadi](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~sjavadi/)

### XV6 Operating System
Xv6 is a teaching operating system developed in the summer of 2006 for MIT's operating systems course,
Operating System Engineering.
xv6 compiles using the GNU C compiler, targeted at the x86 using ELF binaries. 
On BSD and Linux systems, you can use the native compilers; On OS X, which doesn't use ELF binaries, 
you must use a cross-compiler. Xv6 does boot on real hardware, but typically we run it using the QEMU 
emulator. Both the GCC cross compiler and QEMU can be found on the 6.828 tools page. [more](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/xv6.html)
